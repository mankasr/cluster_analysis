All the creatures
On the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Won't you keep this
In between us
Search and seizure, wake up Venus
The dollar bill will
Mentally ill bill
Mum and dad take your 'don't be sad' pill
Turn the screw and
Twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious
There's a reason for the twenty first century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on, wooh
It's my favorite
Combination
Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation
Mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like a Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's time to run this table
There's a reason for the twenty first century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on, yeah
Read me your scripture and 
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it, kiss it
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like a Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's time to run this table
Simple soldier
Hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation
Altercation
Oral sex and bird migration
There's a reason for the twenty first century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be, come on
There's a reason for the twenty first century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to beNEXT SONGI like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painThat motherfucker's always spiked with painLooking in my own eyes hey lordI can't find the love I wantSomeone better slap meBefore I start to rustBefore I start to decomposeLooking in my rearview mirrorLooking in my rearview mirrorI can make it disappearI can make it disappearHave no fearI like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painThat motherfucker's always spiked with painSitting in my kitchenHey girl, I'm turning into dust againMy melancholy babyThe star of mazzy mustPush her voice inside of meI'm overcoming gravityI'm overcoming gravityIt's easy when you're sad to beIt's easy when you're sad, sad like meI like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplanePleasure spiked with painJust one noteCould make me floatCould make me float awayOne note from the song she wroteCould fuck me where I layJust one noteCould make me chokeOne note that's not a lieJust one noteCould cut my throatOne note could make me dieI like pleasure spiked with painAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneSongbird sweet and sour JaneAnd music is my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplaneThat's spiked with painIt's my aeroplaneIt's my aeroplane

Lipstick junkie
Debunked the all in one
She came back wearing a smile
Looking like someone drugged me
That wanted to unplug me
No one here is on trial
It's just a turnaround
And we go, oh
Well then we go uh huh huh oh
Tick-tock I want to rock you
Like the 80s
Cock blocking isn't allowed
Tugboat Sheila is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd
We better get it on the go
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
I said hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
Rain dance Maggie
Advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods
Little did I know
Her body was one
Delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
We've got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone girl
Hey now
We've got to make it rain somehow
She told me to
And showed me what to do
How Maggie makes it in her cloud
I said hey now
I want to rock this rowdy crowd
She told me to
And showed me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
But not for long girl
It's in the song girl
'Cause I'll be gone bye bye bye yeah
Bye bye bye girl
Bye bye girl
Bye bye girl
Bye byeNEXT SONGOh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peacable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
American ghost dance
A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved
American ghost dance

NEXT SONGNever twenty one when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving more with Mister Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
I I I the cry of vacilation
I I I the higher meditation
I I I the sweet precipitation
I I I the higher depravation
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
Rain on my frustration
Save my queen now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three let's make this
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words
One, two, three forsake this
All aboard the ship 'cause
You're going to need arc when
The wet comes down you'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the pain when I'm a little older
Right as rain at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
I I I the cry of vacilation
I I I the higher meditation
I I I the mild precipitation
I I I the higher depravation
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
Rain on my frustration
Save my queen now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three let's make this
Coming through the world I got a feeling of words
One, two, three forsake this
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing the shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat
Something's will die in their place
Others will leave with a trace
Fire will come by its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away
Rain on my frustration
Save my queen now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three let's make this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three forsake this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three let's make this
Read between the sky and every piece of the earth
One, two, three forsake this

Lucy Rebar
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah
Drinking sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a gold mine
but then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah
Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosma shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tender
Why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby 
Any way she can
Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them 
- before
Before it's time 
To close the store
Oh yeah
Distillation
A lonely sycophant
Some liberation
The only seed 
We ever plant
I wanna help you 
But I can't
No no
Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love 'er leave 'er
Got off
Made you a believer
Neon soldiers
Left her
Now you've gotten older

Annie wants a baby 
Any way she can
It's getting longer all the time
It's time to redesign the sign
Oh yeah
Sing along the wayNEXT SONG
Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans
Oh good brother just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy
So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard
Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans

All around the world
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the motherfuckin' girls
From California
Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay
Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the Swiss mountains
Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
'Cause we're rockin' Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure

And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello then I say I do

On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shakin' and a kickin' and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
'cos that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shakin' and a kickin' those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walkin' out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell ya how much we did
Rockin' right out for those itty bitty girls, right out
But here's a funky fact that I know is real,
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!
Got the tunes in my pocket...
Baby appeal...
Rock out!...

NEXT SONG
Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods
Where the Chuck Berrys grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Spinning down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin' out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hitting harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Mr. Uplift Mofo - my man Bo Diddley
Hit sipping a bottle of nickel ripple
Play the lickity split finger lickin' licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
We'll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That's right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That's right he'll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods now
Take me to your backwoods

New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise

Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise Yeah
Blow job park

One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said yes we live behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound
Behind the sun
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if you son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
Behind the sun
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound
Behind the sun

NEXT SONG
Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy
You better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, get down!
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, Get down!

NEXT SONG
Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity
Blood sugar baby
She's magik
Sex magik sex magik
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimensions to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist
Blood sugar baby
She's magik
Sex magik sex magik

NEXT SONG
I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else
Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what when or why
The twilight of love had arrived
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
She meant you no harm
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
He loves no one else

NEXT SONG
Live and die before I get it done, will you decide?
Take my words and turn them into signs that will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rise
And when you hear this, you'll know it's your jam, it's your goodbye
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
We all crossed when we were feeling lost it's just the time
Kateri cried the day her lover died she recognized
Because he gave her a life of real love it's no surprise
The nights are long but the years are short when you're alive
Way back when will never be again, it was a time
It's going to catch you so glad I met you to walk the line
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
Let me live so when it's time to die even the reaper cries
Let me die so when it's time to leave another sun will rise
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

NEXT SONG
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
It was our shoulder space
That made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup
To style out with grace
With a tight turn twist
And a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed
With a kick ass clank
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
So love all your brothers
And love all your sisters
Love all the misses
And love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss
And we ain't sissies
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace potion
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the power of the cup we are about to astound
All your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town
Bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up

Hah, on the ice, no holding my soul
I want men, not mice, no stopping my throw
Hah, get this, reds are back bills
Work or play ball or just turn me loose

Don't give up your fight, in life, you better buckle down
Two days with might, in life, you better buckle down
Leave dreams tonight, in life, you better buckle down
Because I know what's right

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Overload
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
To get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Black jack, dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee
Oversold
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for

Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it

I know you from before
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way I tried to say

Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see
And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, hold me
Compare us to a Ferris wheel
Just be sure what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me
I wanted to get out of here
But every time I reappear
Now I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right

Let's get it right, let's get it right
The spirit of a dragon's tear
Is lovely at this time of year
The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than than it will be wide, hold me
My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me
And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey
C'mon girl, let's get it right

Blessed are the hypocrites
Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey yeah
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right

If I can't find you no one can

Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
I see you in the park
You're always wearing dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and
Anyone from any other crew
I am small but I am strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue
From anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
I'll come around and make peace
Get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake
And do electric boogaloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would
Take a cue from
Anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
If you want me to
What else can I do
'Cause I'm just like you
If you only knew
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron

NEXT SONG
Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden
Dreams of silver screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settles in the final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is that war your waging
First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Marry me girl be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population everybody's been there and
I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest
There is no test
But this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hard core soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

NEXT SONG
Can't stop; addicted to the shindig
Chop Top; he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt; the pistol that you pay for
This punk; the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leading me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
Wait a minute, I'm passing out win or lose, just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew, how about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew, right on cue
Can't stop; addicted to the shindig
Chop Top; he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt; the pistol that you pay for
This punk; the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Come from space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through

Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

In the class she's taking notes
Just how deep deep is my throat
Mother Mary don't you know
She's got eyes like Marilyn Monroe
Catholic school girls rule

From the cross she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
Give no love until you're wed
Live no life until you're dead
The good books says we must suppress
The good books says we must confess
But who cares what the good books says
Cause now she's taking off her dress
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule
Catholic school girls rule

Lead us into temptation
We are pure divine creation
Talking about my generation
Injected with the seed of emasculation

Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell

I am just a lousy bum
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb, the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room, the groom
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot

NEXT SONG
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama she was swinging hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby what you gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Should've seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, too sad sad sad
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

NEXT SONG
Coming on to the light of day we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile
To see what it has to say
You and I both know
Everything must go away
What do you say?
Spinning knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light and a touch of dark you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
But I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go
Blow by blow and go away
What do you say?
Yeah
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Stumble down to the parking lot you got
No time for the afterthought they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut
Well that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and
Find the world at your command
Playing the hand
Yeah
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
Do you want this love of mine?
Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time?
But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Pick you up like a paper back with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack
It's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll
Everything must go away
What do you say?
Yeah
You don't know my mind
You don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm
Falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design
Ah-ah-ah

NEXT SONG
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
By the radio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian
Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I
She's got sword in case
Though this is not her Lord, in case
The one who can't afford to face
Her image is restored to grace
Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase
The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages. No loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights fallen freckles…. away…

NEXT SONG
It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it
Laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving
Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a Bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The motherfuckers woke us up
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs
Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!
We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good
I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butt-hole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
Yea, we were young
And we were looking
Looking
Looking for that deep kick
Yea, seen them come, seen them go
And I feel I'm getting close to you

NEXT SONG
All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else
Another girl bad for my health
Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard
Serenaded by the terror bird
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one
A rolling blackout of oblivion
I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
I'm a broken record runnin' low on luck
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm slow to finish but quick to start
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face

NEXT SONG
Find me in the suburbs and
The shadow of decay
Rolling rings of rubber and
The band begins to play
Am I on the right side of the left side of your brain
Can you see the rising of old yesterday's remains
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
The Stooges and J Dilla, yeah
They tore this town apart
Put me back together, well
I guess that's quite an art
Henry won the war you see
But not with pen or sword
He did it with the little thing I think it's called a Ford
Funkadelic said it best I think you know the rest
Time don't stand a chance against this motor madness
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Don't you worry baby I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Everything's so hazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy I'm like
Detroit, I'm crazy
Everything's so hazy

Come on, come on
I'm coming for you cause, cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has, has got me cringing well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
Unwrap the package without much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?
I want to dance to every days occasion
This I know, yeah this I know
Take me home, well take me home
This I know we're not alone
Take me home, take me home
When we envision, lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on you, you said I grew on you
Turns out that we are all the one solution
GO!
I'm coming at you well, year of the cat too and
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and maybe espouse her, well
She showed me love without the stipulations
This I know, yeah this I know
Take me home, well take me home
This I know we're not alone
Take me home, take me home
I want to lean on you, get Jan and Dean on you
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like your cheeky well, so Mozambiquey and
I think the world could use a clear connection
This I know, yeah this I know
Take me home, well take me home
This I know we're not alone
Take me home, take me home
This I know, yeah this I know
Take me home, well take me home
This I know we're not alone

NEXT SONG
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure
I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'm a meth lab, first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
Come again get me excited
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
Come again make me excited
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
There's a match, now let me light it
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
I'll be there, tell me when you want to go
Come on in and tell me when you want to go
More will be revealed my friend

NEXT SONG
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
In you a star is born and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way that I knew that it would be with you
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life

NEXT SONG
Standing naked in your kitchen
Feeling free that I could be alive
Clearly I'm a contradiction
Too young to be my wife
A peaceful storm is never hectic
Her mellow voice that I could be within
The uniform is anorexic
A jealous choice won't win
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai
Paint your face cause I'm a black foot
I thought I counted up the fireflies
Close enough to get a good look
Time to mobilize
A metamorphosis samurai
Y'got a little lord fish and I don't know why I got a
Metamorphosis samurai
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Taking acid in a graveyard
Stealing food to keep the night alive
Every day I try to play hard
Even with my lies
The day they found you on a tour bus
The news was barren as a desert bone
The tabloids made a kind of small fuss
A couple pictures shown
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
Slowly turning into driftwood
No one ever wants to die alone
Thinking that a pretty gift could
Make you less unknown
Dirty sneakers on the pavement
The brilliant features of a common man
See the miracle of your life
No one ever can
I'm a lonely lad
I've lost myself out on the range
I don't remember much
So don't ask me I've gone insane
See the world go by
The changes that we entertain
I don't recall it all
Remember I have gone insane

Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling I know you must be there
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
Calling, calling, from something in the air
Calling, calling, I know you must be there
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back
Shao Lin shakin' for the sake of his soul
Everything must go
Lookin' mighty tired of all the things that you own
Everything must go
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me, if you will, exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling I know you must be there
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know you're coming back

NEXT SONG
The California animal is a bear
Angeleno, but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I'll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester square
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right
It's all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It's all right
It's all right
Down and out and it'll sound all right
It's all right now
It's all right
The California flower is poppy, child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it'll feel all right

NEXT SONG
Listen to the Beatles and the sound of laughing Ed McMahon, we got high
Educated by a world so full of self and lost in space, too much pride
Cosmonauts and dirty thoughts are juggling the juggernaut, Soviet Spy
Every now and then when I remember to befriend, the little things in life
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now
Later on I'll read to you the things that I've been needing to say goodbye
Walk away from mom and dad to find the love you never had, tell no lies
Carry on and write a song that says it all and shows it off 'fore you die
Take a little breath before you catch an early death there is so much sky
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now
Skinny brains and little stains upon your
Face teenage remains tell me more
Lifted in the fifties when you really rather drifted through time, let's soar
Hey you're fine
I wanna listen to the radio
Driving down Calexico highway
And now I know the signs, for sure, for sure
Hold my hand
I want to share it all with Mary
Results are gonna vary now

NEXT SONG
Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
Well I could be your friend
White clouds I'm in a mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
Well I'm in Michigan
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, yeah
A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan
Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterian's
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Well, I'm in Michigan
Let's float away like Zeppelins
On stoic gusts of Northern winds
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Life is my friend underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
When I'm in Michigan
Throw me in the loony bin
Cause I can take it on the chin
When I'm in Michigan
The cleavage of your pillow skin
Is moving like a violin
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, oh yeah

NEXT SONG
E I O I E I A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for
E I O I E I A
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure
More and more I want to raise
Raise my bar and raise your stay
E I O I E I A
When I lie there wide awake
For my son I'll mate
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road
E I O I E I A
Something good going to come your way
Just look out your door
E I O I E I A
Tell 'em what you wanna say
No matter what you might endure
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road
E I O I E I A
Steal my heart to give away
Make me want to say
E I O I E I A
You and I are so no same
More and more and more each day
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he knows
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that road

NEXT SONG
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for a long long
Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven, not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out
Ah people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl" and
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well
Like I told you be careful what you're asking for
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair."
Like I told you there is something for everyone
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you I'd do it all again
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

NEXT SONG
All my life I was swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple, never playing good defense
Gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there so I couldn't really get her
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore, a busy mind can go berserk
Oh feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip, and I opened up the book
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
Be my wife, I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Crack your whip, she's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there, but not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time, I was searching for a dream
I was slippin' in and out of every other sex machine
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, it's just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
Be my wife, I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Be my wife, I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Be my wife, I think you're right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Faith
And love
Lo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

NEXT SONG
What ever never knew
That I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew
That I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old
But just a little girl
Vibing off the gong
Rubbing on the bowls
Make you float around
Make your loving strong
And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar
You can smell the purple light
Coming from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
Because that's what you are
I want to be your pet
And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into gurumukh

NEXT SONG
All you slingers and friends
Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
I am here today to pump up the Uplift Mofo Party Plan. A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan. There shall be no slaves in the land of lands, it's a Hollywood jam.
You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

NEXT SONG
I was walking through the streets I could not hear my best friend call
He was feeling incomplete about to take his final fall
Last thing I remember there were tears of blood and just not mine
Any other day and I would save you from this cold decline
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in
We were moving in the world, expanding your realities
A force of nature on the verge, commanding abnormalities
Last thing I remember there was ringing in my selfish ears
Twenty-Six a number much too small for someone's golden years
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bit my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in
You get a little bit more this time when
You give a little bit for your brother's kind
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"
You sing a little bit stronger when you
Remember the song of your old best friend
Like she always said, "Oh, Don't look back, just look ahead"
Everything they said about everything
Was a coming undone it's a life supreme
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
Feasting on the flowers so fast and young
It's a light so bright that I bite my tongue
I do and I don't, well I do and I don't, Oh yeah
The next dimension, show me in

Well alright
Now dig this!
You don't care for me, I don't care about that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love with your fire?
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire

Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom isn't home, it's not my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burning desire
Oh, I'm going to do it in your fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Oh, move over, over
And let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns, you know who he gives it to, yeah
That's right
Now dig this!
You try to give me your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
You better slide your ass over, girl
Because I'm coming through once and I'm coming the way you must be

Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do

Funky crime funky crime
Don't you know funk's colors blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Hey you mister interview
I don't have to answer you
This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Cause funk is my attitude
Funk is my attitude
Funky crime funky crime
Don't you know funk's colors blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin'you there is no room
For what you do, don't budge
There's no groove to your gloom
Who made you the judge
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up
Funky boy
Meets a funky girl
Make it funky, baby
Cause the funk is crazy
Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do

Don't you know funk's colors blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind

NEXT SONG
There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man
Confusion is my middle name
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame
You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you
Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' by my lowly creed
Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true likelihood
Of being great is not so good
You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you
There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man
Virtue slipped into my shoe
No I will not misconstrue
More rockin' more rockin' now doobley do
Dancin' down your avenue
You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling for you

Come get me
I bite but she bit me
Go-rilla, cunt-illa
Sammy D and Salmonella
Come with me 'cause I'm an ass killer
You're ill but I'm iller
I'll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on
Get up
Come sit up
I light but she lit up
Grass hopper, show stopper
The life of a wife swapper
Come with me 'cause I'm a big bopper
You do but I wopper
Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on
Get on top
Get on top
Hit me
Come get me
I bite but she bit me
Speed baller, Rhodes Scholar
Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar
Come with me 'cause I'm a free faller
You hoot but I holler

Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top
Get on top

Jump the day away
Jump all over town
Because jumping is O.K. in a jumping kinda way, hey hey
Jump a boy
Jump a girl
Jump a rope
Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumping
Keep your heart muscle pumping
Hillel be jumping on that little baby Frumpkin
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants
When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs getting a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumping foos, jump you
Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumping in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack
Get up and jump

Mister Mexican jumping bean knows
His fun is squeaky clean
Christ, how'd you think that he got so clean
Not from sitting on his goddamn spleen. Get up
Oh, I be jumping I be jumping I be jumping alone

That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend
We would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go you show
Me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Complete repeat
Sitting in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel
Take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound
Turn it up and no we can't be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep
Find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
A lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
That's right you're right
We will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time you're fine
Just another color coded crime
The song is fascination
Another lonely superstar
To get away inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside
The lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride
A May December might not be so smart
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Don't be late cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays

NEXT SONG
What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue
Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes
I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walking like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Oh oh yeah
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom I love her cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feeling good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma

What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling don't stop continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now
Give it away now

NEXT SONG
I called the teacher cause I wanted to confess it now
Can I make the time for me to come and get it blessed somehow
She spoke to me in such a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me feeling in position from
I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore
Somebody hooted and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be, the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth before you start to growl
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
Sometimes I feel like I'm a sentimental trooper
She cried so hard, you know she looked like Alice Cooper
I don't think that it's so personal
Anymore, anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin
I'm kissing high and low
Our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday, what we obey
And now we're welcoming each other to this cabaret
I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore
Tell me now, I know that it just won't
Stop
You will find your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it, so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

NEXT SONG
Indeed it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world gettin naked on the stage
Bustin' people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mammy and our pappy
Funky young kings we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talkin' 'bout my buddy's funk it up fishbone
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day the good time boys that might jest be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's gonna shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Makin' more that money more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea
If you don't believe me you can ask john doe
'Cause his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you 'bout the band called fire hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours
Good good time boys make me feel good
Give me good times yea yea yea yea

NEXT SONG
Suicide a month before I met you
Deep regrets, I never could forget you
Somehow you made your way to my decade
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my girl
In the sun, I see you with your guard down
Number one, you're moving to a hard town
Do not dismiss the promise that you made me
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, my time
Overkill you took another red pill
On the sheet is everything that you spilled
We are the ones you want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo, black light
Come again to murder your report card
Just a friend to kiss you in the court yard
You are the one I want to be stuck with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo big fight
Favor Some
Way too young
Slave to none
Way too young
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Sticky fingers find the way to take her
Crumple up another piece of paper
I know your days are numbered when it comes to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo this life
Slip away into the solar system
Straighter rays, you find a way to twist them
Some like it dark and now I know where to
Ayo ayo ayo ayo find you
Serpentine, I think she was an Aussie
Bloody hell, a common kamikaze
Give up the ghost before you go under
Ayo ayo ayo ayo wonder
Kicking hard and looking for a rescue
Watch me starve was never to impress you
I would have killed the part of me to have you
Ayo ayo ayo ayo story
Say goodbye my love
I can see it in your soul
Say goodbye my love
Thought that I could make you whole
Let your lover sail
Death was made to fail
Babe I know love is a funny thing
Born to die in the eternal spring
Your flickering is more than just a small flame
Welcome to the party, it's a ball game
Pick up the stick it's time to get hit with
Ayo ayo ayo ayo my bat
Suicide is never going to save you
When I cried, it was because I came too
You are the one I want to know right now
Ayo ayo ayo ayo kiss this

NEXT SONG
Junior pimps at old cafe
Gotta chase those girls around
Westbound drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound
Hustlers get what they deserve
But its always half the wait
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have its day
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and Hooray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around oh nah nah nah no!

NEXT SONG
About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend, foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think a different way, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
Because everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace loving whales flow through liquid outer space
A grooving and a gliding as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
Cause dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at 'em with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be moving in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to meet you
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, well that's nothing new
A trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? Cause the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the American tradition
Along with going fishing, apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitchin' seeing dead men in ditches?

NEXT SONG
Drivin' around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwin' me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Makin' my way, I break another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rollin' to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
Sought and I found a life of making my blood-sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
Who you talking to? Talk to me, you
Sound of music
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me

NEXT SONG
Stop marching cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun
Overrated on the form it goes to where you turn
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite!
Stop jumping cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah
Short stroking butterfly
Better to go for broke
What you're smoking? Mary Jane?
And does it make you choke
Jumping the fence, riding the rail
Can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K!
Stop jumping cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah
Tell me now, tell you how
Just show me where to send
Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all learn and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess
Half blinded
I'm reminded how to climb the stairs
Nickel and dime I think
It's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a wandering
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever like never before!
Stop jumping cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah
Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess
Sweet talking, there is a marker
To your part of town
Never again
We're trying to see your love supremed and bound
Is it ever meant to be
And is it so profound?
Is it you and me play it to one make history
A history
Said yeah
Oh yeah

NEXT SONG
Hustle, bustle and so much muscle
Cells about to separate, oh
And I find it hard to concentrate
And temporary, this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
Death defying, this mess I'm buying
Its raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate
And estuary is blessed but scary, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate
And one to treasure the rest of your days here
And give you pleasure in so many ways, dear
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
Here we go
Do you want me to show up for duty
And serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world
And now we are as one
My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure 8
And I'll do my best to recreate
Sweet precision and soft collision, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found

NEXT SONG
Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive?
To survive
Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet
I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Let it on, I'll cut you off
When you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
Say it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name
Play it again and I'll come around, come around
But not for the last time, not for the last time
You used to be so warm and affectionate;
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret;
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away;
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away;
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

All the way back to the brotherland
Take me back, I want to go back, oh
Take me back with my funky ass band
All the way back to the brotherland

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland
Now children, take me on back
Take me on back, take me on back
Take me on back East L.A.

I want to get up and go with my funky ass jams
All the way back to the brotherland

Where the woman is the woman
And the man is the man

I want to go as fast as I can
Slidin' on back to the brotherland

Forty detectives this week
Forty detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin', is that so wrong?
Can I get my co-defendant?
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Oh no!
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump, bump
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now
Workin' the beat as we speak
Workin' the belle du monde
Believe in the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent?
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu

C'mon!
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bop
Hump de bump doop bodu
Bump de hump doop bodu
Hump de bump doop bop
Bump de hump doop bodu
Bump bump
Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now
It must have been a hundred miles
Or any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky?
I'm, I'm wide awake now

NEXT SONG
Woke up this morning like I always do
I still like to think that I'm new
Time just gets its way
Strawberries left to decay
Can't find my pants or my bank account
Don't you slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea
I still like to laugh when I make a joke
I still like to think that there's hope
Time just has its say
Strawberries left to decay
Struck by the sight of an empty hall
Don't you fade away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea
The hunter gets hunted
We all get confronted
Don't just slip away
Voices that start to betray
Even though you raised me I will never be your father
King of each and every Sunset Marquis
Even though you're crazy you will never be a bother
You're my Old Man In the Sea

Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen
What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, Yo
It's all for free
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
Come again and tell me
Where you want to go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, Yo
It's all for free
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
Make me wanna say
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
I could die for you
Whatcha wanna do

There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me, I don't care
You see so what if I bleed
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
A mountain never seemed to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song that would not stay
You see she hides cause she is scared
But I don't care, I won't be spared
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now

Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
I like dirt
I like dirt

The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream
Live in a dream
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt

Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
I like dirt
Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring
Live in a dream
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go
I like dirt

NEXT SONG
And if I had a clue
I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear
I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two
We could take a walk into the
Canyons of the Fifth Avenue
Sing and dance just to name a few
All I do
All I do
And if I heard the Angels sing I'd
Sing it back to you and bring
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you
We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay
A secret little hide away
Spend a little time inside of you
All I do
All I do
All I do
All I do
All eyes
All eyes
All eyes on you
All I do
All I do
All I do
All I do

A want to be gangster
Thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank
He's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head
Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him in the eye
He's not my kinda guy
Never be
Confusion proof
Pudding's sweet
But too aloof
Orange eye girl
With a backslide dew said
Yo homie
Who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon
Mackin' on a cat's ass
One upper cut
To the cold upper middle class
Born to storm
On boredom's face
And a little lust
To the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race
Just lose their grace
The blackest hole
In all of space
Crooked as a hooker
Now suck my thumb
Anybody want to come get some
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
Don't ask me why
I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly
In my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride
She's my freakette
Soak it up inside
Deeper than a secret
Much more
Than meets the eye
To the funk
I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand
Magic on the one
Is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few
Taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face
Like a stage on vaudeville
I feel so good
Can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum
Rockin' my red hood
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go

NEXT SONG
If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there
Then you'll know
For me to stay here
I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Cause I promise
I'll be gone for a while
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman
Taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that
You're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now
When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now
Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good
I wish I could

NEXT SONG
I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God, damn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced
Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Puts us in a pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie
No place for me
I bleed
Kill my trust if you must
But in my blood there is lust for life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing though me like a shark
Crashing though the dark
What am I supposed to do?
I feel like I'm cut into
Confused by rules
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask please tell me fast
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
I took my foot, kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, father help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on my like the morning sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the morning comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man

NEXT SONG
Deep inside the soul hole
Of Mother Earth
Father Time came
With a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can
Erupting from the ground
In Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I am a jungle man
I get all the bush I can

NEXT SONG
Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life
Don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself

NEXT SONG
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road cause we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This is for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street life out my window
City made breeze gonna stroke my skindow
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, Oh yeah!
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around
When I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Wanna feel it all around

NEXT SONG
Throw me all around
Like a boomerang sky
Whatever you do
Don't tell me why
Poppies grow tall
Then say bye bye
The wave is here
A seamless little team
And then we tanked
I guess we're not so sacrosanct
The tip of my tongue
But then we blanked
The wave is here
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side
Ready set jet
But she never gets far
Listen to your skin
From the seat of my car
Two centipedes stuck
In one glass jar
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To tell my side
Whatcha want?
Whatcha need?
Do you love?
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came
Sterile as the barrel
Of an old 12 gauge
Under my skin
And half my age
Hotter than the wax
On a saxifrage
The longest wave
Waiting on the wind
To turn my page
Steady your sails
For the butterfly flap
Whatever you do
Don't close that gap
I'm dreaming of a woman
But she's just my nap
Your ship is in
Waiting on the tide so I can swim
Whatcha want
Whatcha need
Do you love
Maybe I'm the right one
Maybe I'm the wrong
Just another play, the pirate, and the papillon
Time to call it a day
Maybe you're my last love
Maybe you're my first
Just another way to play inside the universe
Now I know why we came
Now I know why we came
Now I know

NEXT SONG
My love comes, and when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows lika a wize guy's tie
In the zanniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be-a-bigger than
The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love is the zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughing boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is getting my food
My love, my love
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby sucking on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the sweedes in the bad
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love
My love is my gross inner-self
My love is my dick in my head
My love is my gross inner-self
My love is my dick in my head
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues

NEXT SONG
Loving and touching and
Laughing and Squeezing and
Walking and Joking and
Smiling and Teasing
Loving and kissing and
Rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and Cumming
I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you
I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love
I will give you my love
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Loving and touching and
Love

NEXT SONG
She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light going to make me come
I say when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to meet
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram and
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah
Oh yeah hey hey
Oh yeah
So alive I arrive on dust, you can search
My mind for the red on rust I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me going to hear my prayers, I said
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better
We are the ones that will make you feel better

NEXT SONG
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact, a claim that remains in tact
M-A-G-I-C see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he doesn't give a [fuck]
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact, a claim that remains in tact
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Because they've got more moves
Than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know of his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar
All-time great super, super star
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact, a claim that remains in tact

Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Like two sweet peas
In an even sweeter pod
That's my friend
And my friend's named Bob
Like the devil knows hell
I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you
‘Bout his 67 smells
Well enough to tell you
He's a hell-a-swell-a fellow
Well enough to tell you
That we know each other better
Than we know ourselves
Like freaks of a feather
We rock together
I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
He's as close to me
As a friend can be
I'll be standin' by my buddy
He'll be standin' by me
Just another half of
The two headed freak
Bit I need him like
My heart needs to beat
At this point
In this friendly verse
I've gotta sing a little something
That I haven't rehearsed
It's about my man
And his name is Hillel
For whom my love
Is soul-brother sacred
Take it Huckleberry
Slim Boy take it
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Jacky's eyes are closed
But he's right on course
Because he's guided by
The invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler
Bad as anybody's Porsche
He's a working class drummer
He's as strong as a horse
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends

NEXT SONG
Please don't ask me who, who you think I am
I could live without that, I'm just a modest man
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do
Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
Please don't ask me where, where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places, but this could be my win
Meet me at the corner where I'll, tell me what to do
Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
Something I wanna show, I thought you ought to know
Please don't say you want to keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner, that I just can't bear
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do
Cause I messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
Head in the clouds, I turned my head when I thought I saw a sign from the gods
A sign from the gods that you were meant to be mine, and it's fine
Taking it all for a ride 'til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where, it all went wrong when it's gone
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, but it's never, it's never, it's never enough, thank you girl for everywhere that I've been

NEXT SONG
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
That I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
Robert Williams, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away now
Good God purple haze now
Good God the baddest of brains now
Good God anyday now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to Mark Twain
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts cause they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo
Good God where's my sleigh now
Good God playing for days now
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane now
Good God rackin' my brain now
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things

NEXT SONG
Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know
Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story

I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, oh oh
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Cat fight intimidation
Oh, oh, oh, oh
To read a mind you've got to
Redefine the line to make your circle sing, you all
He knows everything
You make a sound
The spell is bound to come around
It's just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, oh oh
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Data basing infiltration
I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
To readjust you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king

Right here, girl
Sweet thing, you look so sad
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad

NEXT SONG
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and are you up to task?
The catacombs of bet and bone where cultures come to clash
Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight
The cloth between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear
Several of my best friends know, 
The secrets of this town
And Mary wants to raise it up, 
And Sherry wants to spit it all around, girl
The sailors of the night
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses tonight
Several of my best friends wear, 
The colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, 
And Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The savior of your light
The monarchy of roses 
The monarchy of roses
Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then say I'll want to
The story of love that I'll never taunt you
Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said, hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then I'll say I want to
The story of love that I'll always want you
Hey

NEXT SONG
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, 'cause I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will
Ex girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want, to give her seven years
For being sad
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words, I know of to express
This emptiness
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give, your love
No matter what
Yeah, what she said
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself

NEXT SONG
I used to shout
Across the room to you
And you'd come dancin'
Like a fool
Shuffle step 
You funky mother
Come to me
All warm as covers
Rest with me
My lovely brother
For you see
There is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon
Save me a seat
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can 
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can
In my room
I'm all alone
Waiting for you
To get home
Listen to Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can
Just in case
You never knew
I miss you slim
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can 
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can

NEXT SONG
Standin' on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away gonna make it my home
Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Runnin' through the woods laughin' at the blues
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift good Lord I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny dippin' my way
In the waterfall I just want to play
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle what's your secret
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it

A bonafide bore
What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nap
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blue blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
No chump love sucker
I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
Boys "you dirty rat"
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster

NEXT SONG
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Intercourse with a porpoise
Is a dream for me
Hell bent on inventing 
A new species
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Riding down the path
On the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed
Cause I passed some gas
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well everything is never
Just as it seems
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone

NEXT SONG

I've got myself
In a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go
Shake it off
Just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
Looking up into
A reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up
Another stubborn scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
Sit up straight
I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way
Into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor mouthing off
In front of every other road block
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
Memories of everything
Of lemon trees on mercury
And come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
And you always took me with a smile
When I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through

Good woman said you gotta believe

I am you are me deliciously the mystery, the mystery
We big mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poodle
Ladybug pine tree to mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun and a brother to the cool breeze
One big mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
We live in the city we live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking a thimble humble
Everything you ever see is never more than you and me
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery
One big mob is home
One big mob is home a broken home
I'd like to share some air with you some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives to give and give
What was I thinking in my head the color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration now
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost a sullen cost
good woman said you gotta believe
I am, you are me
I am, you are me submerge into the urge of we
I am, you are me deliciously
I am, you are me the mystery
I am, you are me the mystery
Onebig mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Scrawled upon the wall of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note that spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me 'cause I might be you
One big mob aw yea aw yea
One big mob aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Ek bara mala aw yea aw yea
Picaboo street in Timbuktu

That a boy named Sue
Rockin' to the beat of the kangaroo 
Let me kiss your feet and your forehead too

NEXT SONG
I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike
Am I all alone
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss
Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it
If I chase it I might waste it, come and spit it
Am I all alone
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Close your eyes and click your heels
Can you believe how good it feels
Am I all alone
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
One hot minute and I'm in it come and get it 
If I chase it I might waste it come and spit it
Am I all alone
Am I all alone
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
Say goodbye to where you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your mamma, pay your father take a bow
Say goodbye to where you buy you got it now
Pay your father, pay your twenty, take a bow
Three pounds of love inside my skull
A million more lives it's never dull
Just a few times spun, spun around the sun
A couple more or less and then we're done
Sitting in the fire, I get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher, oh, maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
I'll breathe the moon and eat the sun
Sitting in the fire

NEXT SONG
Oh yeah!
Can you dig it, can you dig it
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when
The 'Fax City Four' were four young men
Time has come, now we jam
With the uplift mofo party plan
We're the organic anti-beat box band
One comes from the holy land
Another was born an Australian
Me I'm from Michigan
But Hollywood is the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle the mind expands
The anarchy for have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass
To the jam that is
We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listen now to this jam
To the power of the drummers bad
It's a Hollywood jam
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rockin' down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
But there's a party in my town
And no beat box jam that is
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked
House got up ran around the block
Sit down house
Take off your blouse
We represent the Hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Any good friend of the lollipop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the Hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
It's a Hollywood jam!

NEXT SONG
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up and brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the other side
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on, take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still a slut
I've got to take it on the other side
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Push the trigger and I pull the thread, I gotta take it on the other side
Take it on the other side
Take it on
Take it on
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the other side
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down
And then it's born again
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side, I don't
I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever
How long, I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slit my throat it's all I ever

NEXT SONG
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton pickin' maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Poppin' hump, hump, hump
Pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
'cause I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!
Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love 'em all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hangin' but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playin', you better be burning Sherman!
We're all a bunch of brothers livin' in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A.
Step out!

NEXT SONG
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first
Under water where thoughts can breathe Easily
Far away you were made in a sea
Just like me
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California king
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything
Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits
In your eye Microcosm
You could die but your never dead spider web
Take a look at the stars in
Your head fields of space kid
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything
Psychic changes are born in your heart entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything

Well, my young lady, she lives
Three houses away
She claims that she can hear moaning and screaming
To me fuckin' you every night
Well, let me say "hey"
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop, he said "That's uncool"
He said that he hears moaning and screaming
To me fuckin' you every night
Well, let me say "hey"

I want to party on, party on your pussy

I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny tiny little ant
Checking out this and that
And I am nothing
Ah, so you have nothing to hide
And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up
Oh yea I'm small
Oh yea I'm small
Fuck you asshole

You're big and tough and macho
You can kick my ass
So fucking what

Police helicopter shot the sky
Police helicopter landing on my eye

Police helicopter, he is not shy

NEXT SONG
I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off to something distant, cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away, but we both know it's somewhere
I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The drift wood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pain
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most convictions
We used to read the funny papers
Fooled around and pulled some capers
Not today, send a message to her
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her
Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
I saw you on a TV station and it made me wanna pray
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone oughta situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way, time to come and find you
But you can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do
Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I left it all for your head
I saw you in the church and there was no time to exchange
You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
And now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today, not for me but someone
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to
Down your country I rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I left it all for your head
I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

NEXT SONG
Porcelain, are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain, do you smell like a girl when you smile
Can you bear not to share with your child
Drifting and floating and fading away
Little lune all day
Little lune
Porcelain, do you carry the moon in your womb
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
Porcelain are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Nodding and melting and fading away
Little lune all day
Little lune
Little lune all day
Little lune

NEXT SONG
I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red black or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menance me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
I've got tapes
I've got c.d.'s
I've got my Public Enemy
My lily white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget, cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity

To finger paint is not a sin 
I put my middle finger in 
Your monthly blood is what I win 
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty 
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante 
Spread your head and spread the blanket 
She's too free and I'm the patient
Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know
Knock on wood we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood 
With Dracula and Darla Hood 
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators 
Let's get it on with the alligator haters 
Did what you did did what you said 
What's the point yo what's the spread
Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know 
And if I call for you to stay 
Come hit the funk on your way 
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is where I go
Knock on wood we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there but I don't care 
'Cause this is what I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good 
'Cause we all live in Hollywood

Feather light but you can't a move this

Purple is a stain upon my pillow 
Let's sleep weeping willow
Black and white a red and blue 
Things that look good on you 
And if I scream don't let me go 
A purple stain I know 
And if I call for you to stay 
Come hit the funk on your way 
It's way out there but I don't care

Lookin' fine, you're lookin' fine and get on nineteen ninety nine it's right on time

Will you be my friend?
Dark ages never change
Well, I can't comprehend
Kiss me, we self destruct
Can you hear me, Lord?
Yes, I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
I am playing for a better day
Playing for a better day, anyway
Oh yeah, I'm playing for a better day
Holy Mother Earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
I thought she had been raped
Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion pleas
That is what she needs
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
And I am playing for a better day
Oh yeah, playing for a better day
Anyway
Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night?
Big thunder rumble fish
But did you get it right?
Headstrong 'bout this song
Exploding souls, be gone
Marvin Gaye, my love
Where did we go wrong?
Righteous and the wicked
Are the war and peace
The righteous and the wicked
War and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P., prodigies of peace
Hear me when I'm calling you
From my knees
Well, I am playing for a better day

Road trippin' with my two favorite allies 
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies 
It's time to leave this town it's time to steal away 
Let's go get lost anywhere in the U.S.A.
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty West of the one 
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
So much as come before those battles lost and won 
This life is shining more forever in the sun 
Now let us check our heads and let us check the surf 
Staying high and dry's More trouble than it's worth in the sun
Just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on 
We three hunky dory's got our snake finger on 
Now let us drink the stars it's time to steal away 
Let's go get lost right here in the U.S.A
Let's go get lost, let's go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty west of the one 
Sparkles light with yellow icing, just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun 
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for 
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for 
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for

Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
To celebrate you is greater
Now that I can, always my man
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for
Misunderstand, all in a hand
Just like you could, you make me
All that I am, all in a hand
A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra the more I have something to bring
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and any damage done will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior
He's just a man, all in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver
Anyone can, always my man
I would never betray you
Look at me, who could raise you?
Face in the sand, safe in your hand
You were always my favorite
Always my man, all in a hand
We are the Red Hots and we're loving lots the love me nots
The flowers in your flower pot are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you in a beautiful and different light
He's just a man and everything he does will be all right
Call out my name, call and I came
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated
You were my man

NEXT SONG
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share...
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health
'Cause with the birds I'll share this lonely view...
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to ma and pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share...
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl
And with the birds I'll share this lonely view...
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know it all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share...
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
With the birds I'll share this lonely view...

NEXT SONG
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're gonna get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumpin' that drivin' bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Suckin' on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to funk, funk, funk, funk your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Push it on in and pull it on out
Pump that lemon 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
Let the beauty of the beat pump your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hump the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady lovin' a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Gettin' it gettin' it gettin' it good
In my head, as a hellified hum
I take to rubbin' her on the bum
Just a little on the tum
With my thumb i stroke her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like oozing hot cum
Well I like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make her cum, make her cum, cum

NEXT SONG
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Aw baby the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue 
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist I kiss your lips
You're my sexy Mexican maid
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
When I wake up in the morn
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that I's a bright and sunny day
So serene she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say she's my sexy Mexican maid
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
She puts me in a bubble bath 
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean 
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap 
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it fast
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm prayin' to my baby she screams
Squeezing me so tight I cry
I'll low you 'till the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone

NEXT SONG
I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving god
We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is something worse
I do not serve
In fear of such a curse
Shallow be thy game
Two thousand years look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company
You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
To anyone who's listenin'
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude
To think that you're above
The laws of nature is a joke
Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and
You'll never burn me
You'll never burn me
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody

NEXT SONG
Looks to me like heaven sinned
No lullaby kid, no five percent
Any way you want to cut that cake
She's a-dyin' from a life of abandonment
Lost in a valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold
It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in
It's a dirty walk back
Gonna learn no way too much
Shootin' dope in the back of a Cadillac jack
Slow down the road to my back forty
She needs somebody to hold
It looked to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Down in the south sea
Give me your mouthpiece
Resuscitation is the way I find these
I give you majors
You give me minors
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner
Now
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
It looks to me like heaven sent this for
Your roughest night
She looks to me
She looks to me alright
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me
She looks to me

NEXT SONG
She's only eighteen
Don't like the Rollin' Stones
She took a short cut
To bein' fully grown
She got that mood ring
Her little sister, Rose
A smell of Springsteen
A pair of pantyhose
This talking picture show is leaking from a silhouette
She said, "My man, you know, it's time to get your fingers wet"
You hustle faster when you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you, why, you were screamin', "Handle it!"
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share
I heard some P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on the lone pine
I'm gonna make you mine
It's understood, you wrap the fool right around my neck
You've got some glitter on ya kitty in the disco tech
I put my lovin' in your oven and I had to check
The last I heard from you a you we're screamin', "Resurrect!"
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share, ooh
Knock the world
Right off its feet and straight onto its head
The book of love will long be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you and what was said
Make a play for all the brightest minds in life will share

NEXT SONG
Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy laugh for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure
Rivers get connected, so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Super heroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail my baby it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
Openly defective is the lover you elected and
A portrait she was bound to portray

NEXT SONG
A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
There's a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Botty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' 'cause she's the receiver
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that I met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man that left me blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea he's the man he's the man he's the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
I got stopped by a lady cop
In my automobile
She said get out and spead your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "what's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little when she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "ooh that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that you met 1 time
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man that will leave you blind
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea, I'm the man, I'm the man, I'm the man 
Sir Psycho Sir Psycho yea
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mama that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while

NEXT SONG
Flashin' lots of cash and spendin' lots-o-loot
He's sitting at the bar then he's sittin' at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
The caboose that could he goes toot toot been known to gag and sometimes puke
A very good friend of granny goose he's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
He's half man and half cartoon
But good buddy don't be confused
He's full blooded Looney Tune
He's a skinny sweaty man, in his green suit, face-to-face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is Doctor Seuss if you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
A skinny sweaty man in his little suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
He was new in town
A freewheelin' clown
A very funny young duke Hangin' under the roof
Of a place in time United sound
He'll play a little guitar, sing a few blues
He's the kind-a-guy that you can't refuse
Despite the fact that he's no brute
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Strike the magic groove, make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
Coming soon to a theater near you
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit

NEXT SONG
Waking up dead inside of my head
Will never never do there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break
It's so bad it's got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
I know a girl
She worked in a store
She knew not what
Her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her
She would never be
As happy as the girl
In the magazine
She bought it with her pay
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Everyone has
So much to say
They talk talk talk
Their lives away
Don't even hesitate
Walking on down
To the burial ground
It's a very old dance
With a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say
Slow cheetah come
Before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come
It's so euphoric
No matter what they say

NEXT SONG
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone
Come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Now listen what I say, oh
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on?
When it's killing me
When will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me
What do I really need
All that I need to look inside
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and hey oh
Look here what I say oh
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up
I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on
Come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
Hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh
Listen what I say, oh
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey, yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey oh yeah, oh yeah
Tell my love now
Hey, yeah, yeah, oh yeah

Next stop on the KLM
Two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when
I get a heavy jam
I'm gonna turn it into hydrogen
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I
Cowgirl and a troubadour
Mgm and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I wanna show you what
I wanna show you what your head is for

NEXT SONG
Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom out into space
And this is where I find a way
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I'm forming I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I'm forming I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling
Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I'm forming I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I'm forming I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I'm forming I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I'm forming I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
The stadium arcadium
A mirror to the moon
I'm forming I'm warning
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
I'm forming I'm warming
To you

NEXT SONG
She's stone cold bush yea
And baby that's alright
She's stone cold bush yea
And that's alright with me
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to life
I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger
She's stone cold bush
Haight Street got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're livin' on the streets
You've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Awe everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you smoke that rock and suck that cock
You do it oh so well
She's stone cold bush 
She's got marble eyes
Sweet china doll her thighs
And animal in pain she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul 
Time after time
She's stone cold bush

NEXT SONG
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off,
Says he's got a bad cough wants to get it paid off
God knows when but you're doin' it again
You better duck down the alleyway lookin' for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills you only got ten
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talkin' at the heat put plants in the bed but the phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may orders from the D.A. the double D.A
Walk on your tip toes, don't try no doz
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out
Looks to me like you did a little to much hittin' kid
You should've took it to the bridge before you started to skid
Look out, kid
The good god willin', we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chillin'em, thrillin'em, and red hot killin'em
Said killin'em
Come on, come on killin'em
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is goin' to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
But users, cheaters, six time losers hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool lookin' for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parkin' meters
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, because it's somethin' that you did
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid
Look out, kid, because they keep all hid, look out

NEXT SONG
Step right up and listen please
You're gonna get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather round all aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And gettin' out is what it's gonna be about 
If you find that you are blind
Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be 
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw be my quest inside my grove
Cause what I've got to give to you
Is gonna make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Cause you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus
Take your body shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants
Space is king or so I sing, subway to venus

NEXT SONG
Should of been, could of been
Would of been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Oh baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep
Cumin' from my stun gun
Beware take care
Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share
Hit me you can't hurt me suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world
That hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me girl
To be your thief
Aw baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound
Of bow wow wow
Oh baby do me now
Do me here I do allow
Hit me you can't hurt me suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
Should of been, could of been
Would of been dead
If I didn't get the message
Goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers
Don't give a damn
Oh baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep
Cumin' from my stun gun
Beware take care
Most motherfuckers
Have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my share
Hit me you can't hurt me suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss

NEXT SONG
Flat on my back
In a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling
Because i can not fall
Asleep tonight
No not at all
Head lights flash
Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open
Because i can not fall
In love with you
No not at all
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
Busted in two
Like a brittle stick
I can not drink
Because my throat constricts
Lovesick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth
I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream
I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk
I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye my love
Goodbye my love
I am not alive
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid

NEXT SONG
This is my time
This is my tear
I can see clearly now
That this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time
This is my tear
Comin' on strong
Baudelaire
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Devil may cry devil may care
Distiller's got a scream
And now I know just why
When she's movin' air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies
Got room to spare
This is my time
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Oh never know
Take it outside
Take it out there
Seems to me like
All the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
All in all I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and end
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
Oh never know

NEXT SONG
Could you turn up the track a little bit, please
My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I supposed to do
Just lose and lose
First time I saw you
You were sitting backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
'Cause the one who hurts can give so much
You gave me such
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

NEXT SONG
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye
'Cause they will find a way to trim it
Everybody
Lookin' for a silly gimmick
Gotta get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high, it's only promising
This place was made on you
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where do you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Sustaining pain to set a mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brothers on the microphone
Getting over with an undertone
It's time to turn to stone
Chitty chitty, baby
When your nose is in the nitty gritty
Life could be a little sweet
But life could be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a Kansas city
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fitty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
Tell me, lover, are you lonely?
The thing we need is
Never all that hard to find
Tell me, baby, what's your story
Where you come from
And where you wanna go this time?
You're so lovely, are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind

Thirty dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms
Along comes Herbie
From thirty-third
And third
Saw the thirty
Dirty birds
Sitting on a curb
Chirping and Burping
And eating
Dirty earthworms
Boy he was
Disturbed

NEXT SONG
This is the place where all 
The junkies go 
Where time gets fast 
But everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline 
Step into a modern scene 
Take a chance of that 
Which seems to be 
The making of a dream
I don't want to do it 
Like my daddy did 
I don't want to give it 
To my baby's kid
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
This is the place
Where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you
What they need
Can I isolate your gene
Can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder
If she's living in a magazine
I don't want to say it
If it isn't so
I don't want to weigh it
But I've got to know
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Ooh
Ooh
I saw you out there yesterday
What did you want to say
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you want to say
A masterpiece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
Can I smell your gasoline
Can I pet your wolverine
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't want to take it up
With Little Joe
I don't want to fake it
But I've got to know
This is my calling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
Hammers are falling
I said my darling
Shocking, appalling
All I can do to you
I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another poppin' Jay
Who thinks he's got
Something to say
Ooh
Ooh

NEXT SONG
Close to my skin
I'm falling in someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone
I'm left alone in another zone
John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail yeah
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you
Sailin' for the sun'cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you I really do I really do
Come closer now
So you can lie right by my side
Sit alone in the sun I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself, yeah
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything 
I will for you
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody close that was made for you
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Close to my skin someone who's been
I'm a falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard
John says to live above hell
My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell

NEXT SONG
I met a man in a rock and roll band he said won't you come with me
I let him know that I could not go you see I get mine for free
We are all just soldiers in this battlefield of life
One thing that's for certain is my burning appetite
Step inside the emotional ride I could use some company
Illusionary is so damn scary I call my best friend Flea
This Ticonderoga is an element that shines
Connected by the great unknown between us there are lines
Yes I told her that
I'm the older cat
Can I scratch your back all day
I would not have it any other way, well
Means so much to me
Can you see the we
What are we ever gonna do when all I want to be is next to you
I took a girl from the underworld and I held her way too tight
When it's all been said and done she was not up for the fight
We are all just soldiers in this open field of time
Hoping to get with you when you get right with your mind
It's my favorite
So I savor it
I must report that life is short
So of your love I'll take ten quarts well
There's no end to this
Don't pretend to miss
You and you would not repent for sitting on my elephant and
Am I crazy to
Join the lazy zoo
All these human butterflies and
Cactus flowers swollen eyes and
I want the devil's share
Of you I do declare
Again I'm asking can I do
When all these animals want to be just like you
I met a girl with long black hair and she opened up so wide
A daffodil growing in Brazil and I picked her for my bride
We are all just soldiers in this epic loving flight
And no one that I know has ever really done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right
Done it right

NEXT SONG
Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for it's collision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old
Throw away your television
Make a break big intermission
Recreate your super vision now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Oh oh oh
Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Reinvent your intuition now
It's a repeat of a story told
It's a repeat and it's getting old
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Throw away your television
Salivate to repetition
Leviate this ill condition now
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat

NEXT SONG
Because I'm happy to be sad
I want it all I want it bad
Oh oh
It's what I know
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
Let's go, oh
It's what I know
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go
It's what I know
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please
The will of God is standing still
Brazilian children get their fill
Let's go
Let's turn it up and dumb it down
The vision of your ultra sound
Is so
All the leaves are turning brown
The wind is pushing me around
Let's go
A vintage year for pop I hear
The middle of the end is near
It's so
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me and torture me
It's forcin' me so torture me please
Torture me with sorcery
It's forcin' me so torture me please

NEXT SONG
You are my god, you are my dog
You kept me close, love never lost
I called you hippie, you said fuck off
Said your brother's a real punk rocker
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me oh over the moon
Friends near death, you gave respect
Sympathetic intellect
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall that's all
Always be loving you
Now I'm away from you
Always be loving you
Round and round inside your head
Smartest fucker I ever met
Vicious fish bit at your toes
Made you lie and numb your soul
Something gonna happen
Something very soon
Transcending flesh could be a breeze
Sending me over the moon
Mule donkey ass you bore the load
Of all creations tortured souls
Choices are, for one and all
All we are is, leaves that fall
Water flowing and I will drink it
I will drink for you
A part of me left that only you knew
Will never be understood, will never be understood
Hey, gone to stay
Entire lifetime flash before me
In a loving stream
Hey mother may I have lost a child
But she gave birth
To a loving stream
Oh, never know
When the gods will come and take you
To a loving stream
Oh, heart of gold
The most special things you gave me were
From your loving stream
In a loving stream
Fuck the magazines
Fuck the green machine
See the human being
In a loving stream
Fuck the legal greed
Fuck the nothing scene
See the family
In a loving stream

Hoo, Lord
Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse through the Hollywood hills
The farther west, the farther out
Yeah, that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust I barbecue my meals
Ridin' wild on a paisley dragon through the Hollywood hills, yeah
Huh, Hollywood hills
Well, I'm gonna ride a saber tooth horse through the Hollywood hills
Just don't show me anything 'cause that's the way I feel
Well, I dig the dirt an' I dig the dust

Passion dripping from the coyote's eyes
He can taste his blood
An' blood never lies pale face die

NEXT SONG
Some of us get a little
And some a lot
We've got to make due
With what ever we got
We get it hot we cool it down
And then we pass it around
You can dance
For the sake of a golden day
Take a chance on getting rid
Of whatever's in your way
Next stop big hop
Is turning night into day
Sometimes when
I'm lying there all alone
I think of every little nothing
That we could own
To overthrow all of you
Who have overgrown
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go
All we know
Heavy load,
Start the float
Without a doubt, we turn it out
And then we turn it again
I've come to learn
Whatever time I can find to spend
Taking flight into
Whatever light we bend
Out on the street
I get the beat and then
I turn it to ten
Lace boots and the
Ladies of Kazakhstan
Kick 'em high to the sky
All of this just because we can
I turn to Cuba
Then Aruba then the Dominican
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go Two things I want to say now
All we know
Heavy load You make it all okay now
Start to float
Without a doubt I need to know that you are there
We turn it out 
And then we turn it again
We've got to move it
If we want to do our best
We've got to shake it
If we want to keep it fresh
I'm turning down
All the heavy psychology
To cut a rug
And I make no apology
I turn a cheek, I turn a key
And then I turn it for free
We've got to move it
Just a little to hit the spot
A whirling dervish in a flurry
A fox to trot
Come clown around, a robot
Doin' the astronaut
All my friends
Like to spend
Days on end
On the mend
I turn to you, I turn into
And then I turn it again
Here we go Two things I want to say now
All we know
Heavy load You make it all okay now
Start to float
Without a doubt I need to know that you are there
We turn it out 
And then we turn it again

NEXT SONG
Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of angel
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds
And she kisses me windy
I never worry
Now that is a lie
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
It's hard to believe
That there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe
That I'm all alone
At least I have her love
The city she loves me
Lonely as I am
Together we cry
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel
Like I did that day
But take me to the place I love
Take me all the way
Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away

NEXT SONG
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admired
Bloodshot your smile
Delicate and wild
Give me she wolf style
Rip right through me
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow
Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run
I saw your crime
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
Beats all hands tonight
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
All the better, to make it so fine
Simply put I saw love stream flow
Come on baby 'cause, there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better then love and service
Universally speaking
I win in the long run
Silveretta the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I've got her on my mind
Nothing better the feeling is so fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow

NEXT SONG
Does it go from east to west 
Body free and a body less 
Come again just to start a fresh 
Once again to find a home 
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh 
Checking in just to get it blessed 
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam 
Where you come from 
Where you going
Where you come from 
Where you going 
Do it all then it all again 
Make it up and you make a friend 
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see 
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend 
Hard as hell just to comprehend 
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze 
Where you come from 
Where you going
Where you come from 
Where you going
We all want to tell her 
Tell her that we love her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever seen 
We all want to kiss her 
Tell her that we miss her 
Venice gets a queen 
Best I've ever
I know you said you don't believe 
In God do you still disagree 
Now that it's time for you to leave 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
Your stylish mess of silver hair 
A woman of your kind is rare 
Your uniform returns to air 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
And now it's time for you to go 
You taught me most of what I know 
Where would I be without you Glo 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend 
My friend
My friend
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be 
A kiss goodbye before you leave 
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love my friend
My friend
My friend

NEXT SONG
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet
In the heat I've got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye, open wide
Blood wood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in a sunny daze
To me now
On a walkabout
You could do it in the city
You could do it in a zone
You could do it in the desert
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies, are what I spy
So fly, you've got to wonder why
The stingrays must be fat this year
Moving slow in my lowest gear
The digeridoo original, man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle
You could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
A walk could cure almost all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One, two
I think I'll go on a walkabout
Find out what it's all about, can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side

NEXT SONG
Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what bobby d was told
I'm walkin' on down the road
Groovin' a tune straight out of the womb
Trust is a must to be a true blue dude
That's a matter of fact don't be confused
Everybody knows true friends are few
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody things, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'cause the streets aren't gold 
And everybody knows what bobby d was told
I'm walkin' on down the road
A like a momma bear hugs her baby bear cubs
A dude he can't lose when he lives on love
Like the bark on a tree
Like the skin on my knees
I'm standin' by my blood
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Everybody knows, everybody things, that I've done wrong
Everybody come in, everybody sing, sing my song
Well I'm walking on down the road
But it can't be heaven
'cause the streets aren't gold
And everybody knows what bobby d was told
I'm walkin' on down the road

Warlocks in wonderland 
I've gotta megatropolis in my hand 
And a, subterranean marching band 
Makin' noise for the man in the Vatican 
And a
A little package and off we go 
Oh, ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe 
I know, everybody's Eskimo 
We've got another thing coming 
And that's our show, well
Every night I go looking for you 
Everyone in the world adores you 
A little pocket of something kind 
To find your reason 
Coming up on it everyday for 
Look at me and it's what I stay for 
A little locket of fantasy 
That we believe in
Lilacs and contraband 
I've got Santa Monica in my hand 
A little, Beatlemania when I can 
And I've got two big bags of old Japan
Ring side and blow-by-blow 
Another, main event at the old rainbow 
We're comin', right on top of the tupelo 
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot
Every night I go looking for you 
Everyone in the world adores you 
A little pocket of something kind 
To find your reason 
Coming up on it every day for 
Look at me and it's what I stay for 
A little locket of fantasy 
That we believe in
Make a deal with Uncle Weezer 
Sign your name to claim 
China Chow will try to please her 
Sweetness came from Jane
Warlocks in wonderland 
I've gotta, Rockapotamus in my hand 
With a, happy ending that's made of sand 
With a little bit of lovin' is all I can
Every night I go looking for you 
Everyone in the world adores you 
A little pocket of something kind 
To find your reason 
Coming up on it every day for 
Look at me and it's what I stay for 
A little locket of fantasy 
That we believe in
Every night I go looking for you 
Everyone in the world adores you 
A little pocket of something kind 
To find your reason 
Coming up on it every day for 
Look at me and it's what I stay for 
A little locket of fantasy 
That we believe in

Shiver for me girl 
Deliver for me my darling 
Pushin' up to you 
A river that runs right through you 
Swim for your smile 
In a blue rock quarry 
Make it for me baby 
You won't be sorry 
Shiver for me now 
Deliver for me my darling
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam 
Settle for love you're never far from home 
Carry me down into the waters of 
Carry me down into the water of love 
Two of us were made of angels dust 
I've been around 
But not around enough
Shadow my free form 
A woman that I could keep warm 
Quiver for me girl 
Give me your head and shoulders 
Shot from the pages of love and glory 
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story 
Shadow my free form 
A woman that I could keep warm
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam 
Settle for love you're never far from home 
Carry me down into the waters of 
Carry me down into the water of love 
Two of us were made of angels dust 
I've been around 
But not around enough
Let's go 
I know, I make it for two 
And if intuition's only what you take from it 
I know, I make it for two 
You were there and I was fortunate 
I know I'll make it for two
And then a messy bed, apology that I will fall for you
I know I'll make it for two
I'll make it for two, I'll make it for two
Shiver for me now 
Deliver for me my darling 
A living that I could 
Be giving to you my sweet love 
Swim for your smile 
In a blue rock quarry 
Make it for me baby 
You won't be sorry 
Shot from the pages of 
Love and glory 
Sleeping next to you 
And I'm in your dream
Settle for love
Settle for love
Settle for love

NEXT SONG
My tendency
For dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me
So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere
Descend
All the way
Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see
Descend
All the way
Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there
Craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold
Descend
All the way
Everyday, warped and scared
Of being there

NEXT SONG
The curtain 
Is open
A head to
Put dope in
Now we will
Come clean it
The future
We've seen it
No, no, I know, I said, no, no
It's like a dream
That falls away
Into the night
Where we can play
I'm on a train
One happy day
Two eyes for sight
Three times I pray
Ooh
Soda pop
We've got to set up shop
And when the weather comes
We've got a pressure drop
We don't know
But everyday I go
To see what I can bring
Into a cameo
Oh oh oh no
We believe
We believe
Climb a tree we believe
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker
The mission
The method
The downfall
Arrested
'Cause it's not
The first time
Nor is it 
The worst time
No no oh no
To see the bird
Without a care
For in a word
It's nice out there
In a tree
My mama bear
Will be all right
With proper care
Hey hey hey do
Boomerang 
Into a bigger bang
A little cry of love
Because they cannot sing
Cherokee
What did the pharaoh see
Another time and space
Another place to be
We believe
We beieve
We believe
We believe
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker
Climb a tree
For monkey business
Write a check out to forgiveness
All the world on half an acre
Pushing dirt into a Quaker
The motive
The measure
The purpose 
The pleasure
The risk is
It worth it
The disc is
It perfect
I found you 
Amongst them
The flower
With young stem
Disparage
The broken
The marriage, eloping

NEXT SONG

We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen
Lost my mind 'cause I'm on the plastic
Who knew it's so damn drastic
Show me what it is you believe in
Slowly she sinks all her teeth in
Do you want to go fishing in New Orleans?
Do you want to get up early in the morning?
Take me to the river where we do the little storming
Hallelujah, I feel it warming
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Mexico, you are my neighbor
Home of the let's be braver
Give me all your sick and your tired
Races that we admire
Do you want to go dancing in Chicago?
Trinidad's got it bad for Tobago
Take me to the lake where we do the Avocado
Hallelujah, a desparado
Sitting here I count the moons
The orders we obeyed
Every night 'fore we go to bed
I watch while the others pray
Send it off through Delaware just
Make it fair for the legionnaires
Paint a simple portrait of my kind
Permission to the heartless bombs
Gold Plated Hate and the waitress moms
Serving up the stories of my mind
Coming down from the deserts where you
Caught a glimpse of the billionaire
Tell me I'm the right one for the ride
Paper signs out on the lawns
Gold minds and the priceless pawns
Does your canyon really open wide?
We got large and we got small
We got a swimming pool and a cannon ball
We turn red and we turn green
It's the craziest thing I've ever seen

NEXT SONG
My shadow side, so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it's soul
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent, why do you care?
Someone start the car
Time to go
You're the best I know
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting now where we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating you like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better baby
God knows that I really have tried
My what a good day for a take-out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but it's soul
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty going toe-to-toe
My, what a good day for a, let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better, oh
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter, yeah
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show
My what a good day for a, walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better, oh
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
I do
Yeah

NEXT SONG
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
How come you treat me like a worn out shoe
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you spot me like you used to do?
When you whisper sweet nothings like you used to do
I'm the same old trouble that you've always been through
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you be the way you used to be?
How come you fight so many fights with me
Somebody changed, so lemme give you a clue
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
Why don't you say the things you used to say?
How come you treat me like a piece of clay
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
So why don't you love me like you used to do?
You can't keep a lovin' and a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
I don't love like a huggin' and a kissin' and I don't know why
We don't get near or further closer land of country mouths
Take the ball

NEXT SONG
Look at that turtle go, bro!
On a far away island of Salamasond
I said, Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean, it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
"I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me"
With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Gave a command
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
Oh, Yertle the turtle
"The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow 
I'm king of a mule"
Look at the turtle go, bro!
Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burpin' little turtle
Looked up and said, "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty?"
"Silence!" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burpin'
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle wow
Yertle, Yertle the turtle look at that turtle go
Yertle, Yertle the turtle bro
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle
Yertle, Yertle the turtle

You always sing, you always sing the
You always sing the same

NEXT SONG
Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash your light on
Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today
Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Pick it up
If not too strong for you
Take a piece
And pass it on
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on my wind
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look
It's on display for you
Coming down
No, not today
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We'll find a place together
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - do you
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Whoa whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa - want to
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my zephyr
We're gonna live forever
Forever
